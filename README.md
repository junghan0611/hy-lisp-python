- Automatically constructing Knowledge Graphs from text documents, semantic web and linked
data
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning

Please note that this repo also contains examples that are a work in progress (these directories conatin a file named **NOT_YET_IN_BOOK.md**).
