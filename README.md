# Code for my book "A Lisp Programmer Living in Python-Land: The Hy Programming Language"

You can purchase the book at [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/hy-lisp-python) or read the book online for free. I offer free updates to new editions to all of my books purchased on leanpub.

This book covers many programming topics using the Lisp language Hy that compiles to Python AST and is compatible with code, libraries, and frameworks written in Python. The main topics we will cover and write example applications for are:

- Relational and graph databases
- Web app development
- Web scraping
- Accessing semantic web and linked data sources like Wikipedia, DBpedia, and Wikidata
- Automatically constructing Knowledge Graphs from text documents, semantic web and linked
data
- Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Deep Learning

Please note that this repo contains examples that are a work in progress for the next edition.
